## Dataset

- This data set includes information about individual rides made in a bike-sharing system covering the greater San Francisco Bay area , the dataset consists of 183,412 rows and 16 columns. the columns are namely ( duration_sec, start_time, end_time, start_station_is, start_station_name, start_station_latitude, start_station_longitude, end_station_id, end_station_name, end_station_latitude, end_station_longitude, bike_id, user_type, member_birth_year, member_gender, bike_share_for_all_trip)

## Summary of Findings

 I discovered that a bulk of riders typically rode the bikes for a duration of 300 - 2000 seconds, with the average trip duration lasting around 700 seconds, this is understandable as bike rides can be quite tasking on the body.
 It was further revealed that 7-8 AM and 5pm experieced high activity on the platform daily, with the typical rider usage of the platform rising from monday till it peaks on thursday before recording weekly lows on saturday and sunday, lending to the belief that the platform is generally used by workers to and from their workplace.

## Key Insights for Presentation

- This report is aimed at showing when most trips where taken based on the week day as well as the time of the day by clients on the bike platform.
- This report also aims to show the relationship between the period when trips are being taken and the nature of the clients either they are the platform members or casual customers.
